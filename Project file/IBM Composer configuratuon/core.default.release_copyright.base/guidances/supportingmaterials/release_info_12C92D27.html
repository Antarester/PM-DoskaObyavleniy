</h4>
<p>
    This is the initial release of the practices library, which is included as part of the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF)
    1.5.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the open source content derives from OpenUP 1.0, refactored to support independent practices.
</p>
<p>
    These are the key new features in the core:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work product slots to allow practices to be independent of each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        Default navigation view that <i>ad hoc</i> configurations of practices can be published easily with a view.
    </li>
    <li>
        Guidance and work products&nbsp;reusable across practices have been moved into common plug-ins.
    </li>
    <li>
        Category, role, and tool definitions separated into separate plug-ins to allow them to be easily removed and
        replaced&nbsp;by alternative categorizations.
    </li>
</ul><p/><h3>
