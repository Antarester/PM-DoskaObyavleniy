        An inventory of an enterprise's installed applications, data, computing and network infrastructure, and the current
        security architecture indicating the existing or planned security zones, secure channels, or network security zones

    It should be noted that this artifact is NOT intended for documenting the results of an assessment of the current

    affected by the introduction of a new package or system).<br />

    The IT Environment typically includes the following sections:
</p>
<h4>
    Introduction
</h4>
<p>
    Describes the scope and context of the IT environment, and includes any other overview information that is of
    relevance.
</p>
<h4>
    Hardware
</h4>
<p>
    Usually production environments, but may include development and test environments as well (if this is relevant).
    Includes CPUs, peripherals, specialist devices (including hardware used by users who have disabilities), and
    communications hardware.
</p>
<h4>
    Software
</h4>
<p>
    This includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Technical Software: Including systems software, middleware, and systems management software
    </li>
    <li>
        Application Software and Databases: Including assistive technology software
    </li>
    <li>
        Application Development Environment: Including development, test, and run-time systems.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Management Processes
</h4>
<p>
    This includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An IT organization chart, including roles and responsibilities
    </li>
    <li>
        A model or list of recognized IT management and governance processes
    </li>
    <li>
        High-level process diagrams (where appropriate)
    </li>
    <li>
        A matrix of IT management processes and owners or participants<br />

    The following general guidance is recommended:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Aim to gather all of the inputs and information needed for a single project at the same time, regardless of the
        artifacts that will be defined. Plan the information gathering as a joint exercise between all interested parties,
        and agree on the tools and techniques to be used, especially as some information gathering activities will cross
        organizational boundaries.
    </li>
    <li>
        When gathering environment information, go beyond the classical information and determine if any limiting
        environmental situations exists (such as noisy plant floors, extra bright areas where it is hard to see a screen,
        or pervasive devices with small, text-only screens).
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify the IT Environment by review with the client sponsor and appropriate senior executives. It may also be
        appropriate to hold a peer and quality assurance review (a peer who has accessibility skills may be necessary in
        complex IT situations).<br />

    Without a comprehensive understanding of the enterprises environment, it is likely that IT strategy, IT planning,
    architecture definition, transition planning, architecture assessment, and system and infrastructure design activities
    will not be soundly based. In particular:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The same information will be required by different project tasks over time, and will be gathered separately and
        repetitively.
    </li>
    <li>
        The information will not be considered when developing alternatives and planning work, and issues will not be
        discovered until the cost of addressing them has increased.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interfacing and transitional issues associated with the introduction of a new package or system may be overlooked,
        or their impact underestimated.<br />

    The IT Environment artifact is usually produced in the form of a report, but may also be delivered in presentation
    format, or may exist as one or more models created using a modeling tool.

<h4>
    Notation
</h4>
<p>
    The notation of the IT Environment is usually in the form of text with supporting tables and diagrams. Diagrams may be
    informal, or created using formal modeling notations such as the Unified Modeling Language 2 (UML 2).
