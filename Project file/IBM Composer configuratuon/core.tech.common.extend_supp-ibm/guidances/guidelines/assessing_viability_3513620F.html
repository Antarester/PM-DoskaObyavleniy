    Viability is typically re-assessed multiple times, as more information becomes available and as the system design is
    developed into more detail.&nbsp; The purpose of the guideline is to provide additional help on the steps of assessing
    the viability of a solution design.&nbsp; The questions are intended to supplement those found in the Viability
    Assessment checklist.&nbsp; It provides a set of review questions that can help ascertain the completeness of the
    solution design and point out common risk areas.&nbsp; It is used as part of the overall process of performing a
    viability assessment.&nbsp; The guideline is organized in terms of five assessment steps conducted at various points in
    time during a project lifecycle:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Assessment of the viability of satisfying qualities and constraints (non-functional requirements)
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessment of a conceptual-level architecture models
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessment of a logical architecture models
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessment of a physical architecture models
    </li>
    <li>
        Conducting the risk assessment<br />
        The steps within each section may be performed in parallel, or in any sequence.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Assessment of Qualities and Constraints
</h3>
<p>
    The goal of this step is to understand if the architecture is based upon a solid foundation of requirements.&nbsp; The
    reviewer is looking for a current, well-articulated and approved set of non-functional requirements (i.e. qualities and
    constraints) to guide architecture development.&nbsp; A good set of architectural requirements will share the following
    characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        They are free from implementation detail
    </li>
    <li>
        They focus upon essential elements of the system
    </li>
    <li>
        They are consistent with one another
    </li>
    <li>
        They are achievable in the context of the "state of the art" budget and schedule
    </li>
    <li>
        They are well formed - concise, unambiguous and verifiable
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;They are traceable to the business goals
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Architecture development depends upon well-formed requirements.&nbsp; A vague statement such as "The system will meet
    the businesses performance objectives" needs to be decomposed into verifiable statements concerning specific
    transactions, users groups and targeted response times.&nbsp;&nbsp; The guiding principle is that things must be
    defined to whatever level of detail is necessary to control the critical aspects of the system.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Compatibility, Conversion, Migration
</h4>
<p>
    If this system replaces an existing system has the architecture accounted for any compatibility, conversion, or
    migration issues?&nbsp; Some areas of concern include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Data from an existing system that must be carried forward (and possibly converted in format) for the new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing user interfaces (screen formats, commands, etc) that must be supported in the new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        An existing application programming interface (API) that must be maintained.
    </li>
    <li>
        Migration from the existing system to the new one that must not disrupt end user service.
    </li>
    <li>
        The new system must be capable of operating in parallel with the old system during the migration period.
    </li>
    <li>
        There must be a capability to fall back to the old system, if needed, during the first two weeks of operation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Old archive data may need to be processes by new system transactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        The objective of this question is to identify things that may influence the design of the new system.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Target Dates
</h4>
<p>
    Are any specific target dates specified or implied?&nbsp; The goal is to understand the architecture's ability to
    support major project milestones.&nbsp; Areas of concern include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Will key architectural decisions be made in time to support the project's schedule?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will standards, reference architecture and models be complete in time to support development teams?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will product selections for architecture components be made in time to support the project's schedule?&nbsp; Is
        enough time allocated to support acquisition, installation and training needs?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the system's infrastructure be turned over to the client before the "go live" date?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the client's operational support of the system be adequate by the "go live" date?<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Try to assess the business impact of missing these targets.&nbsp; If any advantage could be gained by improving on the
    dates, try to assess it.
</p>
<h4>
    Sequence for Implementation
</h4>
<p>
    Is a sequence for implementation suggested or implied?&nbsp; Possible alternatives include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Geographically - by area
    </li>
    <li>
        Functionally - by application
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizationally.&nbsp; For example, an office system may be made available to managers first, then to
        professionals and then to the rest of the organization
    </li>
    <li>
        Some combination of the above
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Sequences of implementation concerns the architect should validate are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Do purchasing and implementation plans support the sequencing approach?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will there be a mixture of new and old technologies that need to be supported for an interim period?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are special features needed in the software/hardware to support the implementation approach?&nbsp; For example, if
        an organizational approach is used, will capabilities be needed to "shut off" solution features until they become
        generally available?<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Times When Implementation Is Difficult
</h4>
<p>
    When will it be difficult to implement a new system?&nbsp; Workload peaks and other factors in the existing systems
    might prevent implementation at certain times.&nbsp; Will the probability of success be diminished because
    implementation is scheduled to coincide with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Larger processing volumes: weekly, monthly or yearly peaks
    </li>
    <li>
        Regular maintenance cycles for hardware or software - impacts both systems availability and staff
    </li>
    <li>
        Peak holiday periods
    </li>
    <li>
        Planned one-off disruptions due to hardware upgrades or introduction of new systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Planned reorganizations
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilities changes<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Application Development Environment (ADE) Considerations
</h4>
<p>
    Identify issues regarding the project's ability to support the application development requirements.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Has the development environment been defined and built?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are the developers trained in using the tools?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are automated tools available for design, test scripting, regression testing, incident tracking and debugging?
    </li>
    <li>
        What type of interfaces and access devices will the system use?&nbsp; Can we support development in these
        platforms?
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Are special media types required, for example, use of graphics, image, voice or video, in addition to
        text?&nbsp; Have we accounted for these needs in the tools chosen?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are automated tools available for version control?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the development environment support the targeted number of developers in terms of capacity and available
        licenses?
    </li>
    <li>
        How will development and ongoing maintenance activities impact production?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the development system need to be stress-tested for capacity and performance analysis?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the ADE have to support several national languages?<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Development Technology Considerations
</h4>
<p>
    Is the project introducing new development technologies that may have implementation, acceptance or "learning curve"
    issues?&nbsp; Look for specific requirements or givens that will be new or unusual for this client.&nbsp; These might
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Is this the first time the client or project team will attempt to adopt new development technologies? For example:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Communication with external organizations such as clients or suppliers
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;First use of Internet or object technologies
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;First use of cryptography
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;First use of development platform (e.g., MVS shop implementing first SP2-based application
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes in scale (for example, a large network with centralized processing in a client with only departmental
        systems installed)<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Development Environment Constraints
</h4>
<p>
    Do the requirements specify or limit how the system should be developed and tested?&nbsp; Examine the requirements and
    current IT infrastructure and standards for any information that will govern how the applications will be
    developed.&nbsp; For example, determine the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Any application packages have been specified
    </li>
    <li>
        Specific programming languages or application generators must be used
    </li>
    <li>
        Specific development methods or tools must be used
    </li>
    <li>
        The client already has existing application development skills, methods or techniques that you might be able to
        exploit
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has any policies regarding making or buying new system
    </li>
    <li>
        The client uses specific testing or certification requirements for proving products or techniques
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has a policy, or an inclination, to use third parties for development of their systems.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Benchmark Requirements?
</h4>
<p>
    Will the new system have to be benchmarked?&nbsp; There still may be clients requesting that the capacity of major
    processing equipment be verified by benchmarks.&nbsp; Others may request performance guarantees.
</p>
<p>
    Benchmarks are very complex, resource consuming activities.&nbsp; Thus, it is important to discuss with the client at
    this point whether the policy calls for full-volume benchmarks, or whether measurements of sample new applications,
    followed by modeling or plain projection, might suffice.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to note that these types of benchmarks will most likely be dependent on the newly developed (or
    acquired) application code, thus making the system design's completion dependent on the progress of application
    development.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Technology Change Management Issues
</h4>
<p>
    What will be new about this system for the users?&nbsp; For each category of user, including administration, operators,
    and end users, identify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Are new technologies being introduced that may have training or acceptance issues (e.g., Web Browsers, hand held
        devices)?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the organization have experience supporting the technologies being introduced?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will there be significant skill gaps that need to be addressed?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will integration with outsourcing organizations need to be managed?
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Supplier Support Structure
</h4>
<p>
    Understand the planned supplier support structure.&nbsp; In most situations, there are some readily identifiable
    suppliers or third parties supporting the client's IT systems.&nbsp; The new system might need some elements of support
    that are not currently provided by them.&nbsp; Identify issues that may be due to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Suppliers' technical skills, strengths and weaknesses
    </li>
    <li>
        Engineering manpower and geographic coverage
    </li>
    <li>
        Second level support the above two issues
    </li>
    <li>
        Commitment to supporting this project from the above groups and executives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Support across national boundaries
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Understand Implementation Dependencies
</h4>
<p>
    On what will successful implementation of the system depend?&nbsp; Are there any events, systems, people, etc., which
    constitute dependencies for this system?&nbsp; We can look the following examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Other systems or facilities that must be implemented or modified before this one
    </li>
    <li>
        Availability of key client and supplier personnel
    </li>
    <li>
        Availability of new products or services
    </li>
    <li>
        Financing being made available
    </li>
    <li>
        Key processes not under direct client control.
    </li>
    <li>
        The delivery of software in the form of a packaged application solution especially a release with new or bespoke
        function.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Create a rough-cut critical route analysis of the dependencies upon architecture activities and deliverables.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Cost Constraints
</h4>
<p>
    What cost constraints are placed on this system?&nbsp; Document any explicit cost limits stated in the
    requirements.&nbsp; Consider especially, costs associated with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Development and testing
    </li>
    <li>
        System management
    </li>
    <li>
        Initial hardware and software
    </li>
    <li>
        Running and maintenance
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    If cost limits have been stated, are they reasonable?&nbsp; From the initial transaction and sizing data, perform a
    very gross sizing of this system.&nbsp; Perform a rough costing exercise, and compare the result with the expected
    benefits.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Expected Benefits
</h4>
<p>
    What are the expected benefits for this system?&nbsp; Is there a Return on Investment assumption?&nbsp; It is useful to
    understand what types and size of benefits the client is expecting from this system.&nbsp; This will provide you a
    better perspective on the relative importance of certain processes and capabilities, as you make design choices.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Reasonable Transaction Volumes and Service Requirements?
</h4>
<p>
    Does a baseline of volumetric and service level information exist which can be used to develop the architecture?&nbsp;
    Important volumetric information needed to support architecture development include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Transaction rates
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of concurrent users
    </li>
    <li>
        User and transaction distribution by geographic locations
    </li>
    <li>
        Processing peaks
    </li>
    <li>
        Service hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Out of service allowance
    </li>
    <li>
        Response times (best case, worst case, average expectation)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    Are the transaction volumes and service requirements reasonable?&nbsp; Can they be supported by the targeted
    technology?&nbsp; Do you believe that the end users would, or could, generate transactions at the&nbsp;rate
    specified?&nbsp; As a start, divide the number of transactions per day, or hour, by the number of users and see if it
    seems reasonable.
</p>
<h5>
    <br />
    Reasonable Data Volumes?
</h5>
<p>
    Are the data volumes reasonable?&nbsp; Can they be held on currently available systems, or, if the requirements lead
    you to believe a workstation or departmental system will be part of the design, can the data reasonably be held
    there?&nbsp; Ensure that important data volumetric are being captured to support the architecture development.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Data volumes to be converted to new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Data volume by projected table or subject area.
    </li>
    <li>
        Growth rates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Update rates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Recovery turn around.
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Data distribution by geographic location.
    </li>
    <li>
        Data transmission volumes over network connections.
    </li>
    <li>
        Archival and retention requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    <br />
    Client Risk Willingness
</h5>
<p>
    All requirements have to be weighed with regards to the client's willingness to accept risks.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Will the customer tolerate budget, technical or schedule risk to achieve project benefits?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the client culture conservative or decision-making?
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Is the client willing to commit to new technology and products?
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Unusual or Challenging?
</h4>
<p>
    <br />
    What is unusual or challenging about this system?&nbsp; Try to identify characteristics of the system that might make
    it difficult to implement and therefore will raise the risk that the system will fail to meet its objectives.&nbsp; Use
    this as a means to summarize the findings for the risk areas examined so far.&nbsp; Examine the following areas for
    potential problems.&nbsp;<br />

<h4>
    Completeness of Requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Assess the completeness of the requirements.&nbsp; Are there major areas of requirements that have not been defined,
    but should have been by this point in the project?&nbsp; Identify which requirements are missing, and how and when
    these missing requirements might be obtained.&nbsp; For instance:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Initiate a subproject to gather them
    </li>
    <li>
        Gather them as part of the application development process
    </li>
    <li>
        Have a business transformation team (business reengineering) provide them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop a prototyping to provide them.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    Comment upon the stability (are they likely to change) of the requirements.&nbsp; Activities such as a business
    transformation exercise or a prototyping project are inherently ‘volatile' because they explore new ways-and-means of
    doing business and tasks.&nbsp; This means that they may change a requirement (say a set of business processes or the
    order that they are executed) while the architecture and design effort is proceeding.
</p>
<p>
    All of this apparent uncertainty of requirements is increasingly common in modern system developments. To summarize,
    consider the following about the requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Complete?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will be complete?&nbsp; (From where will the information come?)
    </li>
    <li>
        Stable?&nbsp; (What is likely to change?)
    </li>
    <li>
        Are your assumptions reasonable?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are they verifiable?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Assessment of Conceptual-level Architecture Models
</h3>
<h4>
    Architecture Context
</h4>
<p>
    Verify that the architecture support the client's and project's goals and directions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Does the client have a strategic IT Architecture that needs to be followed?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the Architecture support the client's principles and standards?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the Architecture support project goals and contractual requirements (e.g., are performance guarantees
        stipulated)
    </li>
    <li>
        What assumptions were made about the activities, work products and funding of the Architecture group in the
        contract?&nbsp; Are these reasonable considering the technical problems to be solved?
    </li>
    <li>
        How does the project scope define the boundaries of the Architecture?
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Architecture Overview
</h4>
<p>
    Review the conceptual architecture as documented in the Architecture Overview artifact.&nbsp; Address the following
    items or questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Are some conceptual nodes going to be more challenging than others are?&nbsp; Which ones and why?
    </li>
    <li>
        Order of development and implementation of conceptual nodes?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have all connection types been identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        At a high level, do we understand the dynamic behavior of the system and inter-node communications?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are the major software components identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have system interfaces, both internal and external been identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are the user groups and remote locations identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the architects prematurely made technology or product decision before understanding the requirements fully?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are the major architectural decisions that have to be made been identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have reusable assets such as Reference Architectures been considered?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is there a plan for the project's architectural activities?&nbsp; Does the plan support:&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;The scope of the stated conceptual architecture?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;The architecture decisions that have to be made
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Work products that have to be produced?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Any contractual obligations (deliverables, service level attainment)?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Migration and Integration Issues
</h4>
<p>
    Are there any major migration and integration issues with this architecture or design as it now stands?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        From an existing system that it might be replacing?
    </li>
    <li>
        From an existing system that it might be enhancing?&nbsp; Take special care when trying to interface network or
        pervasive computing system components to systems that were never designed to embrace them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Does it fit in with existing systems?&nbsp; If no, can these be changed to fit in with it?
    </li>
    <li>
        Considerations for data conversion or creation.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the system must handle requirements for a Version 1 and a Version 2 of the system, will the system be capable of
        being migrated from Version 1 to Version 2?
    </li>
    <li>
        Access to archive data, especially if protected cryptographically.<br />
        Few systems are ever installed into a "green field" so its important to identify other systems or environments
        affected by the deployment of this system.&nbsp; Ask the question "Is migration to this new system possible and
        reasonable?"&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    System Testing Strategy
</h4>
<p>
    Identify how this system will be tested.&nbsp; Complex systems must be tested in parts, and then the parts integrated
    and the complete system tested.<br />
    Show whether the testing of this system will need special attention in later phases.&nbsp; For example, if multiple
    workstation conceptual nodes are to be installed, you will need to test functions of the workstation, its connections,
    performance and system management (including software and data distribution).&nbsp; When identifying such tests, bear
    in mind operational and scheduling constraints and stress testing conceptual nodes.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Special Design Skill Requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Consider especially what special skills are needed to continue the design process.&nbsp; These might be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Knowledge of unfamiliar or special hardware or software
    </li>
    <li>
        Knowledge of an application package
    </li>
    <li>
        Special industry knowledge
    </li>
    <li>
        An exceptionally large design tea
    </li>
    <li>
        A multinational, dispersed, design team
    </li>
    <li>
        Network computing skills
    </li>
    <li>
        Exceptional security requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Object technology
    </li>
    <li>
        System Management expertise
    </li>
    <li>
        e-business
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Training for Users and Operators
</h4>
<p>
    What type of training or retraining is required for users and operators of this system?&nbsp; At this stage you
    probably don't know exactly what the users and operators of the system are going to do.&nbsp; But you may have some
    strong indications from the requirements what the skill levels of the operators are, for example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bank clerks
    </li>
    <li>
        Supermarket checkout operators
    </li>
    <li>
        Shop floor workers
    </li>
    <li>
        Secretaries
    </li>
    <li>
        Graduate engineers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mobile users
    </li>
    <li>
        The IT organization
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    It is useless to expect operators to work the system if they cannot be trained within a reasonable time and at a
    reasonable cost.&nbsp; If they cannot, the system design is not reasonable and needs to be altered.
</p>
<h5>
    <br />
    Cost Violations?
</h5>
<p>
    Are there likely to be any obvious cost violations from this design?&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        User workstation costs far exceed suggested costs per unit in requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Estimated costs of one host computer exceed cost maximum shown in requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    Note:&nbsp; It will not be possible to determine system cost since all the components will not be decided yet.&nbsp;
    But major exceptions from the assumptions made in the contract should be identified as soon as possible and stated as
    issues or project change requests.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Benefits Still Achievable?
</h4>
<p>
    Consider whether any of the benefits you identified previously might now be unachievable as a result of any design
    decisions you have made.&nbsp; If so, document these, and ensure that a strategy is in place to address the
    issues.&nbsp; Escalate to project management if needed.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Design Competitiveness
</h4>
<p>
    Check that the solution design is competitive.&nbsp; The design may not be the only choice open to the client.&nbsp;
    There may be other choices offered by groups within the client's organization, or by external bodies.&nbsp; These may
    not even be based on a computing solution; they may be business-based such as selling part of the enterprise instead of
    upgrading its computing systems.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    New and Unusual Characteristics
</h4>
<p>
    Assess what might be unusual about this system and its design.&nbsp; Is there anything that would require special
    attention such as extra project management or risk analysis effort?&nbsp; Considerations include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Many new and untried component types
    </li>
    <li>
        Many thousands of components
    </li>
    <li>
        Many thousands of end-user operators
    </li>
    <li>
        International scope, especially NLS and communications considerations
    </li>
    <li>
        This system design will cause other connected systems to require a significant change/upgrade
    </li>
    <li>
        This system must never fail
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;The public at large are its users
    </li>
    <li>
        The end users are highly mobile
    </li>
    <li>
        Do you know of any other systems similar to this?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are there any special safety considerations for the system users or the system components as you can now see them?
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Feasibility
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Is it possible to design, implement, and run this system?&nbsp; Some systems are just too huge or complex to ever
        work properly.&nbsp; Is this one of those?
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Is undue risk being introduced through the use of unproven technology?
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Do you need to recommend that a prototype of this application be built to ensure that:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;The system flows are possible?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;The system can be programmed?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;The design matches end-user skills and expectations
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Products work as advertised?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;The system operators can operate the system?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the overall complexity of this system so great that those who come into contact with it can never comprehend
        it?&nbsp; Once again absolute answers are difficult to formulate, but if you suspect the answer to this question is
        "Yes," develop a plan of action.&nbsp; Possible mitigation approaches may include the following:

<h3>
    Assessment of Logical Architecture Models<br />
</h3>
<h4>
    Support Functions
</h4>
<p>
    Specify the new support functions identified by the system design.
</p>
<p>
    At this point of the process a number of "application-like" functions have been identified which in reality serve no
    business function, but rather support the operability of the system.&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Database (DB) design changes and accesses to support mass processing
    </li>
    <li>
        Logical DB recovery
    </li>
    <li>
        Detection of failure, either at the system or application component level.&nbsp; This latter is especially
        important in widely distributed applications such as LAN-connected workstation systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        Support of mobile users<br />
        Common services to multiple applications also should be identified:
    </li>
    <li>
        Operating functions such as start up and shut down
    </li>
    <li>
        Single logon to all applications
    </li>
    <li>
        Backup, archiving and restore of data
    </li>
    <li>
        Data staging services to import / export data:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Event control and work flow of business processes
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Mandatory flow control
    </li>
    <li>
        Asynchronous events handling
    </li>
    <li>
        Application level exception processing:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Monitor functions
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Logical error handling
    </li>
    <li>
        Persistence
    </li>
    <li>
        Hooks to monitor availability and performance
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At this point you should verify that sufficient information has been collected at the functional logical level in order
    to:
</p>
<p>
    1.&nbsp;Proceed with the detailed design regarding the use of these facilities<br />
    2.&nbsp;Ensure that these features are incorporated in the component model<br />
    3.&nbsp;Pass the specifications to Application Developers for inclusion into the development process
</p>
<p>
    In arriving at the present architecture models and application models several assumptions may have been made regarding
    the feasibility of certain software facilities and interactions.&nbsp; Some of these facilities and interactions will
    be provided by system control software but others may have to be provided by application programming.&nbsp; For
    example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Application cannot forward messages so it has to perform stand-in processing
    </li>
    <li>
        Application can tolerate parts of a DB being "corrupt"
    </li>
    <li>
        Check with the Application Development process team (program designers) that these functions can be provided.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Prototype
</h5>
<p>
    If the system, or part of it, looks particularly challenging, especially regarding end user operation and acceptance,
    it may be necessary to build a "proof of concept" prototype.&nbsp; Proof of concept prototypes is also a good practice
    to test and validate any unknowns about the design and/or development environment.&nbsp; For example, a proof of
    concept prototype could be used to confirm / test that a message queuing between a workstation and the central host
    will work, give the required performance, and maintain integrity when the cable is pulled.
</p>
<p>
    Remember that if your application development (AD) environment is new, you may wish to prototype it.&nbsp; For example,
    you may wish to set it up and try developing a small application, as proof-of-concept that the components of the AD
    environment will actually fit together and perform at the required level.&nbsp; Be aware that prototypes need to be
    carefully controlled and thought out.&nbsp; If not, they can soon consume enormous amounts of resource.&nbsp; It is
    important to remember that a prototype is testing particular aspects of the system solution, and that it may be missing
    other features necessary for the system to meet client expectations.&nbsp; Thus, avoid the danger of letting a
    prototype become the real system to satisfy schedule constraints and end user demands.&nbsp; Realize also that the
    prototype should be evaluated and how much effort it will take to do the prototyping.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Development Resources
</h4>
<p>
    Define the development resources required for the infrastructure of each node, for connections between functions, and
    for testing.<br />
    Note that the development environment may already have been defined.&nbsp; If so, determine if any of the newly defined
    system function creates additional requirements.&nbsp; Add more detail on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Specific hardware functions to be supported
    </li>
    <li>
        Data management/creation
    </li>
    <li>
        Connections required for testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Specific compilers/tools required
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of developers required.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Implementation Dependencies
</h4>
<p>
    On what will successful implementation of the system depend?&nbsp; Reconsider what has changed appeared or disappeared.
</p>
<h4>
    Significant Changes?
</h4>
<p>
    Assess the impact of these changes on the schedule for implementation of the system, rejecting any alternatives that
    cannot be implemented within the schedule.&nbsp; For example,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        &nbsp;The first use of network or pervasive computing
    </li>
    <li>
        The first use of PWS
    </li>
    <li>
        The first use of mobile technologies or the Internet
    </li>
    <li>
        Distributed systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes of scale, such as increasing the numbers of users from hundreds to thousands
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing a service to users outside the organization for the first time
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing service to users/businesses in other countries.<br />
        Remember that real people have to use this system.&nbsp; If your design is a radical change for the people or for
        the organization, they simply might not be able to absorb the rate of change, and the system would not be used as
        intended, or deliver the expected benefits.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Major Cost Headings
</h4>
<p>
    Summarize the major cost headings.&nbsp; As the cost model coalesces, is it still in line with proposal
    assumptions?&nbsp; Start to fill in the major items under headings including:

    <br />
    Although the data may not be fully available its useful to build a framework that can be completed in the later
    phases.&nbsp; Raise issues where cost assumptions may be exceeded (see item below).
</p>
<h4>
    Within the Budget?
</h4>
<p>
    Is the system still within the budget?&nbsp; Has the workload increased or are the component and operational models
    defined significantly complex to the point where the planned budget will not be large enough for typical product
    solutions?&nbsp; For example, if the budget is based on an average cost of 5,000 dollars per user, can the function be
    provided in user workstations (and/or host systems) that cost no more than 5,000 dollars per user?&nbsp; Bear in mind
    that there may be trade-off between capital equipment costs and development or operating costs that also need to be
    taken into account.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Benefits Still Achievable?
</h4>
<p>
    Are the benefits still achievable?&nbsp; Do not spend long on this question, but consider whether any of the benefits
    previously reviewed might now be unachievable as a result of any design decisions made.&nbsp; If so, document these,
    and ensure that the sponsor understands it.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Acceptability of System
</h4>
<p>
    Is the shape of the system acceptable to the client?&nbsp; Has it changed to the point where it no longer matches what
    the client wishes to buy?&nbsp; Will they think it is too large and complex for the applications or services they want
    to run?&nbsp; Will the system sponsor be able to "sell" the system to the intended users?&nbsp; Can the service levels
    for the end users be met?&nbsp; Given the revised data and function placement strategy and infrastructure support
    functions, can the service levels that the users require of the business processes be met?
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Reasonable Design?
</p>
<p>
    Check this system design for reasonableness.&nbsp; Examples of why this system might not be reasonable could include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Too complex
    </li>
    <li>
        Too advanced
    </li>
    <li>
        Too costly
    </li>
    <li>
        Unmanageable
    </li>
    <li>
        Unprogrammable
    </li>
    <li>
        Unsupportable
    </li>
    <li>
        Needs technology that is not available or could not be developed
    </li>
    <li>
        Too challenging a time scale for implementation.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Character of the System
</h4>
<p>
    Review the character of the system.&nbsp; Check that the targeted infrastructures still comply with the architecture:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Has their character changed significantly?
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the processing centers handle new workload?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are new infrastructure components sufficiently sized?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are the LANs and WANs defined in the system architecture well matched to the traffic they have to carry?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    If necessary identify the reasons why the system design and the architecture do not match.&nbsp; Have the requirements
    really changed as the design was developed, or did the design not pay enough attention to the architecture?&nbsp; Plan
    whether the architecture is to be changed or the system design is to be reworked.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Will any of these issues affect the availability of the new system?&nbsp; For example, if the new system is to run on
    an existing processor, operating system image, or network configuration, are the availability characteristics of the
    existing platform consistent with the requirements of the new system?&nbsp; Include environmental maintenance and
    physical constraints such as ATM or printer hopper capacities in this evaluation.
</p>
<h3>
    Assessment of Physical Architecture Models
</h3>
<h4>
    Verify Disaster Recovery Design
</h4>
<p>
    Verify the components of the disaster recovery and associated nodes and connections.&nbsp; Consider the components of
    the disaster recovery node(s) and also any support components in the node(s) being protected by the disaster recovery
    node(s).&nbsp; The disaster recovery site has to be kept in step with the normal business system, if it is to be able
    to take over the processing in the event of a disaster.&nbsp; The requirements should have told you how up-to-date the
    disaster recovery site must be.&nbsp; Perhaps it is sufficient to take backup tapes over to the disaster recovery site
    at regular intervals.&nbsp; However, some designs may require more recent data.&nbsp; Perhaps there is a need for
    functions to "collect" any changes to key data records or files, and then transmit these changes via some "sender"
    function, to a "catcher" function in the disaster recovery site.&nbsp; Check the design for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The existence of collector, sender, and catcher software components
    </li>
    <li>
        Adequate processing and storage capacity at the disaster recovery node (note that the disaster recovery node may
        have its own regular workload)
    </li>
    <li>
        The existence of satisfactory connections
    </li>
    <li>
        The means for the switch-over of the network
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    New Support Functions?
</h4>
<p>
    Review the list of new support functions, and check whether there have been any changes, additions or deletions.<br />
    Identify which functions cannot be provided by the components selected (i.e. no reasonable match is available on the
    market).&nbsp; Then decide whether:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You have to return to the use case model, analysis models or design models to reassess the need for the specific
        facility.&nbsp; It is likely that by slightly changing the design or easing up on the requirements the need for
        this facility disappears.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have halt the system design process and request a review with the executive sponsor.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Additional Development Facilities?
</h4>
<p>
    Define any additional development facilities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What new tools will be used to develop and test the new system?
    </li>
    <li>
        What new skills will be needed?
    </li>
    <li>
        How will these be acquired - retraining existing staff or hiring new?
    </li>
    <li>
        How long will it take to create the development environment?
    </li>
    <li>
        How much of the development environment will need to be retained for ongoing system maintenance?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the development functions been assigned to nodes?&nbsp; Included in the sizing data?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the connections between the development and production environments been defined in the system specification?
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <br />
    Skills and Training
</h4>
<p>
    Identify the skills and training that will be required for end users, operators, and support staff.
</p>
<p>
    Now that specific components with which the system will be implemented have been determined, update the training
    assessment that was created previously, and identify any new skills that will be required on the part of end users,
    operators, and support staff.&nbsp; Based on this, identify the specific training that will be required for each group
    (end users, operators, support staff) and potential sources of that training (in-house education staff, vendor-provided
    training, etc).&nbsp; Do not forget any National Language Support considerations.&nbsp; Determine if benchmarking of
    parts of this infrastructure is necessary.&nbsp; Some clients might call these proving or certification trials.&nbsp;
    Benchmarks may have been called for by the client's acceptance process.&nbsp; A benchmark may also be needed if mapping
    the largest node's workload onto the selected components created a borderline capacity projection.&nbsp; On the other
    hand, even if the client's acceptance process normally calls for a benchmark, the projected loading level for the
    selected components may be sufficiently low to convince the client that a benchmark is not actually needed.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    If a benchmark is needed, that recommendation should be made now, in order to allow time for preparations and to guide
    activity in the Infrastructure Components phase.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Identify Possible Product Sources
</h4>
<p>
    Identify possible sources for the products selected including client- and vendor-developed products.&nbsp; Do suppliers
    and products have to support certain criteria and standards?&nbsp; What is more important to success, use of emerging
    technologies for optimum solutions or proven concepts?&nbsp; Vendor selection should be based on two criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Technical aspects.
    </li>
    <li>
        Non-technical aspects such as presence and support in the country, market acceptance, and the likelihood they will
        be around in the future.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Remember that some clients might prefer the purchasing department to make the final choice of supplier for certain
    types of component.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    4.6&nbsp;Refine Cost Figures
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Refine the costing.&nbsp; Check whether the system design already has exceeded its budget.&nbsp; Check whether the
    design is still competitive.&nbsp; For a system with few different types of nodes, a quite accurate estimate can be
    made.&nbsp; For a system with many nodes of different sizes, accurate costing will be possible only after the design is
    complete.<br />
    Add more detailed headings to the cost summary you started earlier.&nbsp; Remember to consider:<br />
    •&nbsp;Maintenance<br />
    •&nbsp;Development<br />
    •&nbsp;Operations<br />
    •&nbsp;Communications facilities<br />
    •&nbsp;Personnel<br />
    •&nbsp;Space, power, and other facilities<br />
    •&nbsp;Supplies<br />
    •&nbsp;Education.
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Additional Product Benefits
</h4>
<p>
    Review the selected components for additional potential benefits to the client beyond those they explicitly stated in
    the requirements.&nbsp; Plan how they are to be treated in evaluating the alternative designs.&nbsp; Can the benefits
    be added to the system evaluation criteria?&nbsp; Can the benefits be used to assist the sponsor in selling the system
    to others in the client organization?
</p>
<h4>
    <br />
    Benefits Still Achievable?
</h4>
<p>
    Are the benefits still achievable?&nbsp; Do not spend long on this question, but consider whether any of the benefits
    you previously reviewed might now be unachievable as a result of any design decisions that have been made.&nbsp; If so,
    document and ensure that the sponsor understands it.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Ability to Deliver
</h4>
<p>
    Review the system for reasonableness:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Does the complexity of the system match the type of function it is designed to provide?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does it match the skill and experience of its users?&nbsp; Of its operators?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does it have too many (or non-complementary) architectures?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does it have too many component types?
    </li>
    <li>
        How effective is system-wide security?&nbsp; Do all the security components work together to provide protection?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the system meet its availability targets?
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;How many components have to be operational for the users to receive service?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;How many staff will be involved in recovery from a failure?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;How long will recovery take?
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Are there enough components to ensure recovery?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    Do the products and techniques on which the system is based match its expected life?&nbsp; An interim (tactical) system
    with a short life can safely be built using old technology because it will soon be discarded.&nbsp; A system with a
    long life expectancy (most systems) should be built on up-to-date technology and methods so it can be maintained and
    expanded to support future requirements.
</p>
<h3>
    <br />
    Conducting the Risk Assessment
</h3>
<h4>
    <br />
    Risk Identification
</h4>
<p>
    <br />
    1.&nbsp;Start by hypothesizes on the possible risks using the results from the assessment steps.&nbsp; Test the
    hypothesis.&nbsp; Find potential disconnects among the work products or within the architecture models.&nbsp; For
    example, a disconnect would be a use case that is not reflected in the analysis model or an improper design
    model.&nbsp; Once the disconnect is identified determine if it is the source of a risk or evidence of another hidden
    problem. List the technical risks in the categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        High - will stop the project completely (critical)
    </li>
    <li>
        Medium - might stop the project completely (potentially critical)
    </li>
    <li>
        Low - a problem but not a critical one (nuisance)<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    By identifying a risk in any of the above categories you are signaling that you consider there is a reasonable
    probability that the events that define the RISK might actually happen.&nbsp; You need to decide what ‘reasonable'
    actually means in your context.&nbsp; Is it 10%, 30%, 50+%?&nbsp; You will need to take a consistent view so that you
    don't cause confusion.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    2.&nbsp;Look deeper into your identified risks as to how they might make the project and therefore the successful
    delivery or running of your system, fail.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        &nbsp;It will not work at all
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;It will work with limited function, service, or benefits
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;It will work but will be delivered late
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;It will work but will cost too much to develop (often associated with late delivery as above), or operate
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Some of the above may be acceptable and not represent a risk.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    3.&nbsp;Identify the high and critical risks and decide upon containment actions for them.&nbsp; This is an especially
    appropriate action for a system design team to do.&nbsp; If the requirements are too difficult to understand do not
    proceed with the design but do more work to clarify them.&nbsp; In particular identify those risks that need urgent
    action.&nbsp; A risk may be graded as medium, but the need to deal with it may be much more urgent than a particular
    high risk that will not stop the project for say a year.
</p>
<p>
    4.&nbsp;Ensure that your issues list is updated with your new risk assessments, containment's, and urgency.
</p>
<p>
    5.&nbsp;Communicate your risks and your plans.
</p>
<p>
    6.&nbsp;Make sure your risks and their associated containment actions are communicated, where appropriate, to the next
    phase of the design for that phase to work with them.&nbsp; If you do not have a risk containment plan for each risk
    seek assistance.<br />
